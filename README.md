# File Overview
**VTiger_API.py** - This file is where we create the Vtiger_api Class. The Vtiger_api class uses the requests library to query the VTiger API and retrieve data regarding the open and closed cases from today and this past week. 

**app_gui.py** - This is the main program file and contains all the logic of the GUI program. The primary function here is "self.manual_refresh_data()." This function uses the VTiger_api Class to retrieve all the data and push it into the various widgets that were created in app_gui.ui.

**app_gui.ui** - This ui file is generated by PyQT5's QTdesigner to create and edit the layout of the GUI file. It is imported into app_gui.py. To edit the layout, add widgets, rename widgets etc., open up this file in QTdesigner and save the changes as app_gui.ui.
